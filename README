The Assemble and Animate Control Framework for Modular Reconfigurable Robots. 

The objective of ASE is to provide a flexible and extendable control framework, 
which facilitates rapid development and deployment of modular reconfigurable robots. 

The ASE Control Framework includes: 
+ A simple event-driven application framework
+ A library of common control and adaptation strategies
+ A module abstraction layer which allows ASE to be cross-compiled and ported to new platforms 
+ A number of different modular robotic platforms targets
