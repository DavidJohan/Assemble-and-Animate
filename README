The Assemble and Animate Control Framework for Modular Reconfigurable Robots. 

The objective of ASE is to provide a flexible and extendable control framework, 
which facilitates rapid development and deployment of modular reconfigurable 
robots. ASE includes a simple event-driven application framework, a library 
of common control and adaptation strategies, and a module abstraction layer 
which allows ASE to be cross-compiled for a number of different modular robotic 
platforms and easily ported to new platforms.
