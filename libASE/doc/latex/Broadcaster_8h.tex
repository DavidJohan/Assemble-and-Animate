\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{Broadcaster_8h}{Broadcaster.h} enables the modules to broadcast messages, each module in the robot will received the broadcasted message once. Received messages must elsewhere be forwarded to the broadcast(.) function, which will make the decision on whether or not to transmit the message further. This file is used by \hyperlink{MCManager_8h}{MCManager.h}
