The overall objective of the ASE project is to develop a control framework for modular robots that enables rapid development and deployment of robots. To fulfill this goal, the ASE control library will be:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Extendible with new algorithms and support of new robot systems.
\item Flexible to enable a user to manipulate the control system of a modular robot as easy as the user can manipulate and reconfigure its modules.
\item Adaptive to automatically adapt the robot behavior to match the robot's configuration, environment, and task.
\end{DoxyItemize}
